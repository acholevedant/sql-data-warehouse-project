# 📦 Modern Data Warehouse & Analytics Project (SQL Server)

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse & Analytics Project** — a comprehensive, hands-on demonstration of how to build a modern data warehouse using **SQL Server** with a focus on **ETL processes, data modeling, and advanced analytics**.

This project simulates real-world data operations and analytics workflows, from raw data ingestion to business-ready dashboards, empowering data-driven decision-making.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This SQL portfolio project demonstrates how to:

- Design a robust **data warehouse schema** (Star/Snowflake)
- Perform **data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL)**
- Implement **data quality checks and cleansing techniques**
- Apply **business rules and transformation logic**
- Handle **historical data and SCDs**
- Build an analytics layer to derive actionable insights

## 🔄 ETL Process Breakdown

### 🟡 1. Extract
- 📥 **Pull Extraction**
- 📁 **Full Extraction**
- 📄 **File Parsing**

### 🧹 2. Data Cleansing
- ❌ Remove Duplicates  
- 🔎 Data Filtering  
- 🧩 Handling Missing Data  
- 🚫 Handling Invalid Values  
- ␣ Trimming Unwanted Spaces  
- 🔄 Data Type Casting  
- 📊 Outlier Detection  

### ⚙️ 3. Transformation
- 💡 Data Enrichment  
- 🔗 Data Integration  
- 📏 Data Normalization  
- 🧱 Data Standardization  
- 📚 Data Aggregation  
- ➕ Derived Columns  
- 📜 Business Rules & Logic  

### 📤 4. Load
- ⏱ Batch Processing  
- 💾 Full Load  
- 🧹 Truncate & Insert Strategy  

---

## 🕰 5. Historization – Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)

- ✅ **SCD Type 1** – Overwrite technique  
> Maintains the most recent data by replacing old values without storing historical changes.

## 🏗 Data Management & Architecture

### 🧱 Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)

This project follows a layered approach for optimal data processing and quality control:

- **Bronze Layer**: Raw, ingested data (staging tables)
- **Silver Layer**: Cleansed, validated, and enriched data
- **Gold Layer**: Aggregated and business-ready data for reporting

### 🧠 Data Management Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each module handles a specific function independently.
- **Non-duplication of Components**: Ensures clean, scalable architecture without redundancy.
